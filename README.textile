h2. Overview

DungeonTimer is a simple addon for keeping track of your times running 5-man dungeon instance.
Unlike similar addons, this one does not require you to use the "Looking for Dungeon" (LFD)
tool in game.

The timer is started when you first enter combat and is stopped when you kill the final boss
of the instance.

TODO:
* Replace the stopwatch-based timer with an internal one
* Track best and average times for each instance seen
* Add a LDB plugin with a useful tooltip
* Add support for pre-LK instances
